> [!NOTE]
> This project integrates the MITRE ATT&CK framework with advanced red team tactics to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities in Windows systems.

> [!TIP]
> Use PowerShell scripts with advanced obfuscation techniques to create Fully Undetectable (FUD) payloads that can bypass Windows Defender.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Regular updates to FUD payloads are necessary to keep up with the latest Windows security features and ensure continued effectiveness.
