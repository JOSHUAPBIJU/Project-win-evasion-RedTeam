# Red Team Tactics

## Introduction
In today's evolving cybersecurity landscape, the threats are becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect. This project aims to examine and test the security of Windows systems, specifically focusing on understanding the capabilities and limitations of Windows Defender. By thoroughly testing Windows Defender, we can assess how well it protects against different cyber threats.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to develop an innovative approach that integrates the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix with sophisticated red team techniques to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities within Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems.

## Expected Outcomes
- Detailed report examining the efficacy of Windows Defender and identifying possible weaknesses within Windows 10 and 11.
- Creation of FUD payloads that can bypass the latest Windows security measures.
- An advanced red team strategy guide enhanced by the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix.
## Impact
This project will significantly impact cybersecurity by uncovering new insights into the security vulnerabilities of modern operating systems, aiding professionals in better predicting and defending against future cyber threats.

## Conclusion
The project aims to advance red team engagements and push the limits of current cybersecurity practices, providing deep insights and tools for better security measures.
